Taught myself how to:
Use VBA to start a function using buttons
Open a files and use MsgBox.
Build macros and refine the VBA code to format tables
Use Array formulas to compare the two tables.
Convert it all into a reusable Template.

To USE:
Download the Audit_AdoptionsVsScraper2.xlsm file.
The other files are merely for reference...
For an audit to work, you need files TO audit.

This file is very company specific, but I
certainly loved learning how to do it!
