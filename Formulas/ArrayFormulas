So you want to find data that HAS to match in the same row BUT 2 columns?!
Came to the right place!

Be careful when using array formulas:
They eat so much memory it is not even funny! :O
Granted I would audit 4-5,000 lines, but
I would have to wait 6 full minutes for my
computer to catch up.

This particular formula is easy to understand, but has several steps.
Where Column E is the Course Section Number
If E3 is on the SCRAPER tab, do the array formula,
else "Missing Class"

Performing the array formula:
Since E3 IS found in the SCRAPER tab,
see if there is ALSO a match for G3 (Book ISBN),
but not just a match, it HAS to be be on the same line as
where E3 matched.
This is the same as before, but all you do is MULTIPLY
the second argument parameter.

Finally
Instead of hitting ENTER like with normal functions,
we must hit CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER because of there being an
array: (E3=SCRAPER!E:E)*(G3=SCRAPER!G:G)


=IF(
ISNUMBER(
INDEX(
SCRAPER!E:E,
MATCH(E3,SCRAPER!E:E,0)
)
),

IF(
ISNUMBER(
INDEX(
SCRAPER!E:E,
MATCH(1,(E3=SCRAPER!E:E)*(G3=SCRAPER!G:G),0)
)
),

"MATCH","MISSING ISBN"),
"MISSING CLASS")
