Find Left of Character
LEFT(text, number to stop at)
But the trick is:
How do we do that if all we have is character we want to find?
FIND(character, in text)
However this will return everything left of the character INCLUDING
that same character, which is why we add a -1 afterwards.
=LEFT(
D3,
FIND("@", D3)
-1)

Just like in LEFT, we need to find the number of at which the character
we want to find is positioned at.
we do use FIND() again, but the length is INVERTED to where we want it.
First we have to find the entire length of the string/text
then we can subtract what FIND returned.
This is similar to counting from the end of the text, instead of 
from the front.
=RIGHT(
D3,
LEN(D3) - FIND("@", D3)
)
