This bad boy can let your custom function use intellisense!
There are two ways to do so. 
A complicated wa,
a kinda unFUN but certainly effective way.

I chose the later.
If you're going to be making custom functions, chances are you're probably going to make them in an addin or in PERSONAL.
Should you decide to do so inside a pre-existing workbook, at least you can hide a tab... I think.
Please check out my own Add-in for details.
