This is a small Add-in I created to help me at work.
I build custom formulas, that work WONDERS with Excel DNA's Intellisense.

It's pretty small, but saving things as addins via ".XLAM" are a bunch easier than
using PERSONAL, because it's a quick file share between coworkers/collegues.

To create your own add-ins, SAVE AS => .XLAM :D
