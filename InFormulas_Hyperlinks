Hyperlink is useful if you want to make a BUNCH of links
automatically, duh. But here is where complimentary formulas help a LOT

In this instance not all cells in the table may contain the data we are
looking for, we don't want an ugly error showing up, so we use ISBLANK().

Numbers and Strings(text) don't always play nice in Excel.
We have a 10 digit ISBN number, and defintely NEED all 10 numbers, we can use
TEXT() and include how many zeros we need. In this case, 10.
=IF(ISBLANK(K3),"",
HYPERLINK(
CONCATENATE("https://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/",TEXT(
L3,"0000000000")),
I3))
